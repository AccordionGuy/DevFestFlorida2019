    "# What is VADER?\n",
    "**[VADER](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment)** is short for Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner. It‚Äôs a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is *specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media.* VADER is particularly good at getting the general ‚Äúvibe‚Äù of text that confuses other sentiment analysis tools, since it‚Äôs good at figuring out things such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* typical negations, such as **not good**\n",
    "* use of contractions as negations, such as **wasn't very good**\n",
    "* conventional use of punctuation to signal increased sentiment intensity, such as **Good!!!**\n",
    "* conventional use of word-shape to signal emphasis, such as using **ALL CAPS** for words and phrases\n",
    "* using degree modifiers to alter sentiment intensity, including intensity boosters such as **very** and intensity dampeners and mitigating phrases, such as **kind of**\n",
    "* understanding many sentiment-laden slang words, such as **sux**\n",
    "* understanding many sentiment-laden slang words as modifiers, such as **uber** or **friggin** or **kinda**\n",
    "* understanding many sentiment-laden emoticons, such as **:)** and **:D**\n",
    "* translating utf-8 encoded emojis such as üíò and üíã and üòÅ\n",
    "* understanding sentiment-laden initialisms and acronyms, such as **LOL** and **WTF**"
